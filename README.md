# FinGuru
Our App is driven by a strong belief in the importance of financial services in people's lives. Our 
inspiration lies in the desire to simplify access to these services through innovation and user-friendliness. 
This app provides users with real-time information about home and educational loans, as well as auto insurance, 
utilizing their personal data. 

The future of FinGuru involves expanding our services to offer advice on new types of financial products, 
staying current with market trends, and gathering user data for further enhancements and policy customization.

## Inspiration:
We understood the importance of financial services in people's lives. This app was inspired by a desire to simplify and improve access to financial services through efficient and user friendly methods.

## What it does:
Our app provides an innovative way for people to get to know about their out of door information about insurance price at the palm of their hand. It provides information about home and education loans along with auto insurance by taking in user's data.

## How we built it:
We used java for backend to build the android application, xml for the frontend to design the app and make the UI interactive. We used firebase and Googlecloud as the database to store user information.

## Challenges we ran into:
We had to learn legal issues related to features of our applications. Implementing RecyclerView and storing user provided information in the database posed some issues for us due to this being our second project in Android Studio.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are proud of the fact that we were able to successfully implement a user friendly and secure platform. We acheived good experience of UI/UX development and a deep understanding of financial neccessities in the market.

## What's next for FinGuru:
We plan to offer advice on new types of loans and insurance products in the future. Our app will stay upto date with the market trends in the financial trends and will change accordingly. We will also focus on gathering more user data for enhancements and offering more customization for policies.
